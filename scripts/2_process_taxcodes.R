# Chapter 2: Process tax districts by tax code -------------------------------

# This script uses tax code data from CMAP copy of county assessor records and
# tax code detail reports from each county to determine exactly which taxing
# districts are in which tax codes.

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(openxlsx)

## 0. Helper functions for this script -----------------------------------------

# helper function to run "reports" on each output
report <- function(df){
  df <- df %>% 
    map(unique) %>% # this converts each table column to a list, and takes unique entries from each
    map(sort) %>%  # sort those unique entries
    map(paste, collapse = "; ") %>% 
    as_tibble() %>% 
    pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "district type", values_to = "districts")
  
  unsep <- filter(df, str_detect(districts, ","))
  
  if(nrow(unsep) > 0){
    message("Some districts not yet separated:")
    print(unsep)
  }
  
  return(df)

## 1. Load required resources --------------------------------------------------

# districts by taxcode

# naming table
