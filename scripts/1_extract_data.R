# Chapter 1: Extract data from necessary sources -------------------------------

# This script reads source data from the "raw" and "resources" folder of the
# github library as well as the CMAP "data depot" V drive and interprets it.
# Each imported and processed list is then exported to an RData file in the
# "internal" folder. Later sripts load these files from "internal" for use in
# analysis.

# This script DOES NOT need to be repeated entirely every time this the analysis
# is run. Rather, components of this script will need to be rerun as their
# underlying data changes or issues with that particular resource are
# identified.

## 1. Parcel data from assessor files ------------------------------------------

# The goal of this section is to use CMAP's copies of assessor PIN data to
# produce two outputs: (1) a list dfs of all PINs with their class, tax code,
# and EAV or MV; and (2) a list of vectors of tax codes with PINs in them.

# This code section is time consuming and needs to only be run if there are
# changes the assessor files, or for a new year. Each year, field names will
# need to be checked to confirm the right PIN, CLASS, TAX CODE, and EAV/MV
# fields are named.

## 3. Extensions by taxing district --------------------------------------------

# This section is designed to interpret files from county clerks to obtain
# extension by land use data for taxing districts that are not listed in Table
# 28. The goal here is to add missing data for ad valorem special service areas
# and, in the case of Cook County, home equity assurance districts.
#
# In some cases, these data come from publicly available tax extension reports.
# These reports tend to include tax extensions for ALL districts, duplicating
# IDOR's Table 28. In script 3, when this extension data is loaded in, a filter
# is applied to keep only SSA-type districts. Table 28 is preferred for a few
# reasons: (1) we believe IDOR to report data consistently across counties, and
# have no guarantee of that at the county level, (2) not all counties publish
# extension data by land use in a public forum, and (3) IDOR data rolls up
# extensions of certain overlapping districts into known muni/township districts
# that are less likely to be missed. (E.g. municipalities with fire and/or
# library districts that are a part of muni government -- we note these as
# "municipal fire", "municipal library", etc)
#
# In the cases of Lake and Will County, we were not able to identify public
# sources for this data, so instead emailed contacts at the county clerk offices
# to specifically request this data for ad valorem SSAs. In these cases, the
# data includes ONLY SSAs, so there is no data that duplicates table 28.

## 5. IDOR Table 28 ------------------------------------------------------------

# IDOR Table 28 provides extension by land use data for all non-SSA taxing
# districts. Note that the underlying excel is modified by the following code. The
# issue here is that Table 28 in it's original form includes SSAs in muni and
# county entries. This is bad news for effective rate calculation because not
# all county/muni taxpayers pay into those SSAs. IDOR table 27 contains (among
# other things) SSA extension totals for various units of government in IL.
# Table 28 is modified to remove SSAs from the topline totals, so that that SSA
# extensions can be applied to the specific tax codes where they are levied.
