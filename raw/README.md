# Raw input files

The files in this directory are collected directly from County Clerks. There are two files for each county:

1. Tax code reports list taxing districts in each tax code. These are key data sources for the `2_process_taxcodes.R` script. They are all publicly available. 
2. extension reports from which extension by land use are collected or calculated for ad-valorem SSAs and other districts without extension data in Table 28. In the case of all counties except for Lake and Will, this data comes from extension detail reports that include all districts in the county. Lake and Will have no publicly available data that includes SSAs, so their spreadsheets are obtained via private communication with Clerk staff.
